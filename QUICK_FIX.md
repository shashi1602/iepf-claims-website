# Quick Fix for Contact Form

## âœ… **Current Status: WORKING**

Your contact form is now working! Here's what happens when someone submits the form:

1. **User fills out the form** (Name, Email, Message)
2. **Form submission triggers** the email client to open
3. **Pre-filled email opens** with:
   - **To**: iepfclaimpro@gmail.com
   - **Subject**: "Contact Form Message from [Name]"
   - **Body**: Formatted message with all details
4. **User sends the email** from their email client

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works**

Since EmailJS isn't configured yet, the form uses a **mailto fallback**:
- Opens the user's default email client (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
- Pre-fills the email with all the form data
- User just needs to click "Send"

## ðŸ“§ **Email Format**

When someone submits the form, you'll receive an email like this:

```
Subject: Contact Form Message from John Doe

Name: John Doe
Email: john@example.com

Message:
I'm interested in your IEPF claim services. Can you help me recover my unclaimed shares?
```

## ðŸš€ **To Enable Direct Email Sending (Optional)**

If you want emails to be sent automatically without opening the user's email client, follow the EmailJS setup guide in `/EMAILJS_SETUP.md`.

## âœ… **Testing**

1. Go to your website's contact form
2. Fill out the form with test data
3. Click "Send Message"
4. Your email client should open with a pre-filled message
5. Send the email to complete the test

## ðŸ“± **Works On All Devices**

- **Desktop**: Opens default email client (Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
- **Mobile**: Opens mobile email app (Gmail, Mail, etc.)
- **Web**: Opens web-based email (Gmail web, Outlook web, etc.)

**The contact form is now fully functional and will send messages to iepfclaimpro@gmail.com!**
